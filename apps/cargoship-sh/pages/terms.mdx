## Intellectual Property

Unless otherwise stated, the Site is our property and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website design, audio, video, text, photographs and graphics on the Site (collectively, the "Content") and the trademarks, service marks and logos (the "Marks") contained therein are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of Germany, international copyright laws and international conventions.
The Content and Marks are provided on the Site "AS IS" for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the Site and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express prior written permission.

If you are eligible to use the Site, you are granted a limited licence to access and use the Site and to download or print one copy of any portion of the content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Site, the Content and the Trademarks.

Certain items provided with the Services may be subject to "open source" or "creative commons" or similar licences (collectively, "Open Source"). The Open Source licence terms are not intended to supersede or be overridden by the licence and other terms of these Terms; however, the limitations of liability, disclaimers and this provision shall apply to such Open Source.
Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the terms and conditions of any applicable Open Source licence, or gives you any rights in lieu of those terms and conditions. If we (or you) make modifications to the Open Source, and if the applicable Open Source requires that such modifications be made available, and if we (or you) have not already published such modifications through the applicable Open Source community, then the modifications will be available on the applicable websites.

## User registration

You may be required to register with the Site in order to use some of our services. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password.
We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.

In order to create an account for yourself or your organisation on our website, you must be a natural person over the age of 16 or a duly registered legal entity.
If you decide to create an account for your organisation, you represent that you have the authority to act on behalf of your organisation and to bind your organisation to these terms and conditions.

When you create your account, we will ask you to provide us with some basic information, such as your email address, password, username, full name, and other optional information such as payment information if you choose to purchase any of our paid services. All information must be accurate and current.

## Payment

Our plans and the fees payable for the use of the Services you choose to purchase are available at https://cargoship.sh/pricing.
You may choose a customised plan, in which case the fees payable and payment terms will be subject to further discussion and mutual agreement with us and will be set out in the applicable Services Agreement, Order Form or other binding document signed by us.
All fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, which you are solely responsible for paying.

We reserve the right to change our prices from time to time at our sole discretion.
If we do so, the prices will remain fixed for the term of your original subscription and the adjusted charges will only apply after the term of your new subscription.
Plans are billed in advance on a monthly basis, and usage-based charges, which apply if you exceed your allotted usage, are billed on an as-needed basis.

Payment is processed on the website using the services of a third party payment. The payment processor's or credit card company's agreement governs your use of the particular account or credit card you provide, and you must refer to that agreement, and not these Terms, to determine your rights and obligations with respect to that agreement, account and activities.
By providing us with your account or credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that we are authorised to immediately bill your account for all fees due and payable and that no further notice or consent is required. You agree to notify us immediately of any change in your billing address or the account or credit card used for payment.
All fees are non-refundable and exclusive of any applicable taxes, which you are solely responsible for paying. You will reimburse us for any taxes relating to your purchase or use of the Services, other than taxes relating to our income.
