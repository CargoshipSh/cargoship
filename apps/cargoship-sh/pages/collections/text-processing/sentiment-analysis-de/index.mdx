Automatically detect the language of an input text. The model uses [Googles Bert](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) architecture and was trained on 1.8 million German-language samples. The training data contains texts from various domains like Twitter, Facebook and movie, app and hotel reviews. The model itself is 440MB and needs an aditional 500kB for the tokenizer.

## License

The model is licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). The code for the API wrapper is also licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU<br/>
**Recommended**: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU

## Usage

**Input [POST]**

```json
{
  "text": "Ich mag Dich."
}
```

**Output**

```json
{

Make sure you have Docker installed then run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 --env API_KEY=CHANGE_ME cargoshipsh/sentiment-de:main
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to call the API

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'X-API-Key: CHANGE_ME' --data '{"text":"Ich mag Dich!"}' http://localhost:80
```

You see the output of the model in the terminal.

```bash
{"sentiment":"positive"}
```
