Automatically generates text by completing a given input text. This is a GPT-J model provided by EleutherAI on [Huggingface](EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) and was trained on the [Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), a large-scale curated dataset created by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/). The model itself is 24 GB in size and needs an aditional 1.5MB for the tokenizer.

## License

The model is licensed under [Apache-2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The code for the API wrapper is licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 12GB RAM, 1 vCPU<br/>
**Recommended**: 24GB RAM, 4 vCPU

## Limitations

GPT-J has been trained on the [Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), a dataset known to contain profane, lewd and otherwise offensive language. Depending on the application, GPT-J may produce text that is socially unacceptable.
Although the model operates on a token-by-token basis, it appears to respond meaningfully to the input text.

## Usage

**Input [POST]**

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, I'm a language model"
}
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, I'm a language modeler. The data coming from the model is the value of the model's function. For example, the values
stored in a table are the first row, the first column from the model, if any, and the"
}
```

You need to set an API Key via the environment variable `API_KEY` to run the image and set the `X-API-KEY` header in your request with the same KEY.

### Example

Make sure you have Docker installed then run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 --env API_KEY=CHANGE_ME cargoshipsh/text-generation-en-lg
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to call the API

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'X-API-Key: CHANGE_ME' --data '{"text": "Hello, I'm a language model"}' http://localhost:80
```

You see the output of the model in the terminal.

```bash
{"text": "Hello, I'm a language modeler. The data coming from the model is the value of the model's function. For example, the values
stored in a table are the first row, the first column from the model, if any, and the"}
