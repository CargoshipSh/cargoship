Automatically detect the language of an input text. This model is based on [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) and is trained on data from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/eng/) and [SETimes](http://nlp.ffzg.hr/resources/corpora/setimes/). The model itself is only 917kB in size and doesn't require a GPU to run.

docker run -p 80:80 --env API_KEY=CHANGE_ME cargoshipsh/language-detection:main
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to call the API
