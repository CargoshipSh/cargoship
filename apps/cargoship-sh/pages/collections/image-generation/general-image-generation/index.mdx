Automatically generates any kind of image. This Stable Diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), [runway](https://github.com/runwayml) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). The StableDiffusionPipeline is capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion). On a 2060s GPU it takes only a few seconds to generate an image.

## Demo

Coming Soon

## License

The model is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and the code for the API wrapper is licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 8GB RAM, Nvidia GPU with 6GB VRAM, 10GB disk space<br/>
**Recommended**: 16GB RAM, Nvidia GPU with 16GB VRAM ,100GB disk space

## Usage

**Input [POST]**

The input expects a prompt and an optional neg_prompt as strings. The prompt should be what you want to create. The neg_prompt or negative prompt should contain things you don't want to appear in the picture.

```json
{
  "prompt": "a photo of a cowboy in a formula one car"
}
```

**Output**

The output is a 512x512 pixel png-image as bytearray

```json
{
  "img": "a person riding a surfboard on top of a wave in the ocean"
}
```

You need to set an API Key via the environment variable `API_KEY` to run the image and set the `X-API-KEY` header in your request with the same KEY.

### Example

Make sure you have Docker installed then run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 --env API_KEY=CHANGE_ME cargoshipsh/image-generation-sd
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to call the API

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Api-Key: CHANGE_ME" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "a black cat drinking coffee, photorealistic, 8k, detailed, illustration, artstation, realistic, mdjrny-v4 style", "neg_prompt": "cartoon, comic, 3d, bright, (deformed), (extra limbs), blurry, boring, sketch, lackluster, watermark, low res , horrific , mutated , artifacts , bad art , poor quality , low quality"}' localhost:8000 > cat.png
```

The image is saved in your current directory.
