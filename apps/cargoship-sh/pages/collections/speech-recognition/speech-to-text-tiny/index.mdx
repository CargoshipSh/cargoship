Whisper is a Transformer based encoder-decoder model, also referred to as a sequence-to-sequence model. It was trained on 680k hours of labelled speech data annotated using large-scale weak supervision. This model was contributed by [openai](https://huggingface.co/openai).

The model is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and the code for the API wrapper is licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU<br/>
**Recommended**: 4GB RAM, 4 vCPU

## Usage

**Input [POST]**

The input expects and image. This can be a URL or a base64 encoded image.

Option 1: URL

}
```

Option 2: Base64

```json
{
  "base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD/2wBD..."
}
```

**Output**

The output is one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes

```json

### Example

Make sure you have Docker installed then run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 --env API_KEY=CHANGE_ME cargoshipsh/image-captioning
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to call the API

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'X-API-Key: CHANGE_ME' --data '{"url": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1677496891133-f81cc7a4e56e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=80"}' http://localhost:80
```

You see the output of the model in the terminal.

```bash
{"caption": "a person riding a surfboard on top of a wave in the ocean"}
```
