  title: "Using the Cargoship Cloud API 🛰️",
};

Welcome to the bridge, captain! It's time to learn how to control the helm and steer your way through the Cargoship Cloud API.

Our API is simple and consistent. We have different machine learning models, but the API always follows the pattern: `https://app.cargoship.sh/api/[task]`

For example, if you want to use sentiment analysis, the URL would be: `https://app.cargoship.sh/api/sentiment`

## Selecting a Model 🧙‍♀️

For some tasks, we have multiple models (for different languages, different sized models, etc.). You can specify the model you want to use with the `?model=[name]` parameter.

For example, to use the German sentiment model, the URL would be: `https://app.cargoship.sh/api/sentiment?model=de`

## Input and Output Definitions 📥 📤

The specific definitions of the input and output for each task can be found on the task's overview page in the Cargoship Cloud.

For instance, for sentiment detection, you might have:

**Input:**

```json
{
  "text": "I like you"
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive"
}
```

## Example: Using the API with JavaScript 💻

Now that you understand the basics, let's take a look at a code example. Here's how you might call the sentiment analysis API using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Required Node.js module
const axios = require("axios");

// Define the API endpoint
let url = "https://app.cargoship.sh/api/sentiment";

// Define the data to send
let data = {
  text: "I like you",
};

// Define the headers for the HTTP request
let headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY", // replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API Key
};

// Use Axios to send a POST request
axios
  .post(url, data, { headers: headers })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. Also, make sure you have the axios library installed in your Node.js project (you can install it with npm install axios).

With the Cargoship Cloud API at your command, your software will be powered by AI in no time!
