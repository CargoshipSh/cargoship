Developers need to adapt to these new techniques and learn how to implement them.
This includes evaluating:
- Which model is good,
- which model do I need,
- How was it trained,
- What type of licence does it have,
- And how to implement it.

For a non-ML expert, these steps are hard work and often lead to frustration or even a return to normal coding without AI.
Because AI is a fast-growing field, many platforms and players have created their space to find and use all kinds of models.
These platforms do a great job, but none of them are suitable for absolute beginners and even for experts it's often time consuming to find the best model for their needs.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
