The easiest way to deploy the Cargoship models on your own server is using Docker and Traefik. Traefik is a reverse proxy that can be used to route traffic to your models. It can also be used to automatically generate SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
You can also use your own domain name and configure Traefik to use it.

## Install Docker

We are starting with a clean Ubuntu 22.04 server. First, we need to install Docker. You can find the official installation instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

First make sure you have no other Docker installation on your system and remove it:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

Then install Docker. First update your package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Add Docker's official GPG key:

```bash
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use then use the following command to set up the repository:

````bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;

````
