# 🚢 Cargoship - Integrate AI into your Application

Choose a model from our collection and use it with zero machine learning knowledge to build amazing products.

> :ship: This repository is still in an early stage of development. We love the open source community and want to show what we are working on early. We will update this readme with more information once it is safe to use. Until then, feel free to share your thoughts, contact us, and contribute if you'd like.

## What are we building?

No AI engineer? No problem! No matter if Image Recognition or Language Processing - we provide a collection of AI models that you can easily add to your application. All models are pre-trained and packaged in an easy-to-use API.

## How does it work

We curate great open source models from all over the web (Huggingface, Github,..) and build models ourselves. We wrap these models in an easy-to-use API and package them as Docker containers so that any developer can easily deploy and access them.

## What are the models?

Here are the models we collected and wrapped so far:
